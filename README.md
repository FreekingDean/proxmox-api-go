# Proxmox API Go

This work is thanks to all of the base set by
https://github.com/Telmate/proxmox-api-go .

Proxmox API in golang. For /api2/json. Autogenerated from json schema as supplied
by the Proxmox team. It uses the doc site Javascript file to scrape & parse the schema: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/proxmox/pve-docs/master/api-viewer/apidata.js .

Note: After https://bugzilla.proxmox.com/show_bug.cgi?id=4456 is hopefully addressed we can automatically pull in the JSON simply.

## Updating

```sh
make download-schema
```
